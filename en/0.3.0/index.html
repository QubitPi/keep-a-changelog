</pre> <h3>What’s the point of a change log?</h3> <p>To make it easier for users and contributors to see precisely what notable changes have been made between each release (or version) of the project.</p> <h3>Why should I care?</h3> <p>Because software tools are for people. If you don’t care, why are you contributing to open source? Surely, there must be a kernel (ha!) of care somewhere in that lovely little brain of yours.</p> <p>I <a href="https://changelog.com/podcast/127">talked with Adam Stacoviak and Jerod Santo on The Changelog</a> (fitting, right?) podcast about why maintainers and contributors should care, and the motivations behind this project. If you can spare the time (1:06), it’s a good listen.</p> <h3>What makes a good change log?</h3> <p>I’m glad you asked.</p> <p>A good change log sticks to these principles:</p> <ul> <li>It’s made for humans, not machines, so legibility is crucial.</li> <li>Easy to link to any section (hence Markdown over plain text).</li> <li>One sub-section per version.</li> <li>List releases in reverse-chronological order (newest on top).</li> <li>Write all dates in <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> format. (Example: <code>2012-06-02</code> for <code>June 2nd, 2012</code>.) It’s international, <a href="https://xkcd.com/1179/">sensible</a>, and language-independent.</li> <li>Explicitly mention whether the project follows <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>.</li> <li>Each version should: <ul> <li>List its release date in the above format.</li> <li>Group changes to describe their impact on the project, as follows:</li> <li><code>Added</code> for new features.</li> <li><code>Changed</code> for changes in existing functionality.</li> <li><code>Deprecated</code> for once-stable features removed in upcoming releases.</li> <li><code>Removed</code> for deprecated features removed in this release.</li> <li><code>Fixed</code> for any bug fixes.</li> <li><code>Security</code> to invite users to upgrade in case of vulnerabilities.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <h3>How can I minimize the effort required?</h3> <p>Always have an <code>&quot;Unreleased&quot;</code> section at the top for keeping track of any changes.</p> <p>This serves two purposes:</p> <ul> <li>People can see what changes they might expect in upcoming releases</li> <li>At release time, you just have to change <code>&quot;Unreleased&quot;</code> to the version number and add a new <code>&quot;Unreleased&quot;</code> header at the top.</li> </ul> <h3>What makes unicorns cry?</h3> <p>Alright…let’s get into it.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Dumping a diff of commit logs.</strong> Just don’t do that, you’re helping nobody.</li> <li><strong>Not emphasizing deprecations.</strong> When people upgrade from one version to another, it should be painfully clear when something will break.</li> <li><strong>Dates in region-specific formats.</strong> In the U.S., people put the month first (&quot;06-02-2012&quot; for June 2nd, 2012, which makes <em>no</em> sense), while many people in the rest of the world write a robotic-looking &quot;2 June 2012&quot;, yet pronounce it differently. &quot;2012-06-02&quot; works logically from largest to smallest, doesn&#39;t overlap in ambiguous ways with other date formats, and is an <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso8601.htm">ISO standard</a>. Thus, it is the recommended date format for change logs.</li> </ul> <p>There’s more. Help me collect those unicorn tears by <a href="https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog/issues">opening an issue</a> or a pull request.</p> <h3>Is there a standard change log format?</h3> <p>Sadly, no. Calm down. I know you&#39;re furiously rushing to find that link to the GNU change log style guide, or the two-paragraph GNU NEWS file &quot;guideline&quot;. The GNU style guide is a nice start but it is sadly naive. There&#39;s nothing wrong with being naive but when people need guidance it&#39;s rarely very helpful. Especially when there are many situations and edge cases to deal with.</p> <p>This project <a href="https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">contains what I hope will become a better CHANGELOG file convention</a>. I don&#39;t think the status quo is good enough, and I think that as a community we can come up with better conventions if we try to extract good practices from real software projects. Please take a look around and remember that <a href="https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog/issues">discussions and suggestions for improvements are welcome</a>!</p> <h3>What should the change log file be named?</h3> <p>Well, if you can’t tell from the example above, <code>CHANGELOG.md</code> is the best convention so far.</p> <p>Some projects also use <code>HISTORY.txt</code>, <code>HISTORY.md</code>, <code>History.md</code>, <code>NEWS.txt</code>, <code>NEWS.md</code>, <code>News.txt</code>, <code>RELEASES.txt</code>, <code>RELEASE.md</code>, <code>releases.md</code>, etc.</p> <p>It’s a mess. All these names only makes it harder for people to find it.</p> <h3>Why can’t people just use a <code>git log</code> diff?</h3> <p>Because log diffs are full of noise — by nature. They could not make a suitable change log even in a hypothetical project run by perfect humans who never make typos, never forget to commit new files, never miss any part of a refactoring. The purpose of a commit is to document one atomic step in the process by which the code evolves from one state to another. The purpose of a change log is to document the noteworthy differences between these states.</p> <p>As is the difference between good comments and the code itself, so is the difference between a change log and the commit log: one describes the <em>why</em>, the other the how.</p> <h3>Can change logs be automatically parsed?</h3> <p>It’s difficult, because people follow wildly different formats and file names.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/tech-angels/vandamme/">Vandamme</a> is a Ruby gem created by the <a href="https://gemnasium.com/">Gemnasium</a> team and which parses many (but not all) open source project change logs.</p> <h3>Why do you alternate between spelling it &quot;CHANGELOG&quot; and &quot;change log&quot;?</h3> <p>&quot;CHANGELOG&quot; is the name of the file itself. It&#39;s a bit shouty but it&#39;s a historical convention followed by many open source projects. Other examples of similar files include <a href="https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog/blob/main/README.md"><code>README</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog/blob/main/LICENSE"><code>LICENSE</code></a>, and <a href="https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md"><code>CONTRIBUTING</code></a>.</p> <p>The uppercase naming (which in old operating systems made these files stick to the top) is used to draw attention to them. Since they&#39;re important metadata about the project, they could be useful to anyone intending to use or contribute to it, much like <a href="https://shields.io/">open source project badges</a>.</p> <p>When I refer to a &quot;change log&quot;, I&#39;m talking about the function of this file: to log changes.</p> <h3>What about yanked releases?</h3> <p>Yanked releases are versions that had to be pulled because of a serious bug or security issue. Often these versions don&#39;t even appear in change logs. They should. This is how you should display them:</p> <p><code>## [0.0.5] - 2014-12-13 [YANKED]</code></p> <p>The <code>[YANKED]</code> tag is loud for a reason. It&#39;s important for people to notice it. Since it&#39;s surrounded by brackets it&#39;s also easier to parse programmatically.</p> <h3>Should you ever rewrite a change log?</h3> <p>Sure. There are always good reasons to improve a change log. I regularly open pull requests to add missing releases to open source projects with unmaintained change logs.</p> <p>It&#39;s also possible you may discover that you forgot to address a breaking change in the notes for a version. It&#39;s obviously important for you to update your change log in this case.</p> <h3>How can I contribute?</h3> <p>This document is not the <strong>truth</strong>; it’s my carefully considered opinion, along with information and examples I gathered. Although I provide an actual <a href="https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">CHANGELOG</a> on <a href="https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog">the GitHub repo</a>, I have purposefully not created a proper <em>release</em> or clear list of rules to follow (as <a href="https://semver.org/">SemVer.org</a> does, for instance).</p> <p>This is because I want our community to reach a consensus. I believe the discussion is as important as the end result.</p> <p>So please <a href="https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog"><strong>pitch in</strong></a>.</p> <footer class='footer clearfix' role='contentinfo'> <img src="/assets/images/keep-a-changelog-mark-f8b06a42.svg" width="30" height="30" class="mark" alt=""/> <p class='about'> This project is <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/">MIT Licensed</a> // <a href="https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog/">Created & maintained</a> by <a href="https://olivierlacan.com/">Olivier Lacan</a> <a href="https://ruby.social/@olivierlacan" rel="me" aria-label="Link to Olivier Lacan's Mastodon account"></a> // Designed by Tyler Fortune </p> </footer> </div> </article> </body> <script>
